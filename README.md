## WeRatedogs Data Wrangling Project

In this project, I leveraged my data wrangling abilities to extract real-world data from Twitter, clean it up, and perform some analysis. Data preparation is a very important task in every step of a data analyst's workflow. To create my investigation, I combined an image prediction dataset with the original Twitter data from @dog rates. WeRateDogs is a well-known Twitter hashtag where users score dogs using a denominator of 10, and a numerator that is typically greater than 10 to indicate how adorable the dog is.

The WeRateDogs Twitter account @dog rates's tweet archive is the dataset that was analyzed. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that assesses users' pets and adds a lighthearted comments. The denominator of these scores is nearly always 10. nevertheless, the numerators? frequently more than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.  Over 4 million people follow WeRateDogs, and it has been featured in international media.
